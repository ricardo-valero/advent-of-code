# My first ever AOC

I know how to move my way around TypeScript. 
I am hoping I can use Effect... or at least refactor my current code.

```bash
node hello.js // I never use this
bun run hello.ts < input.txt
pnpm tsx hello.ts < input.txt
```

I am also trying out OCaml.
Obviously with Nix. 

Running stuff
```ocaml
print_string "Hello, World!\n";;
```

```bash
ocaml < hello.ml
```

This was useful for my vscode setup

I also want to try Python
with nix
do i need poetry? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqXWrkvZ59g

```bash
python hello.py < input.txt
```

I tried Go but removed it 
```bash
go run Hello.go
```

I still don't know why I don't use devenv. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
